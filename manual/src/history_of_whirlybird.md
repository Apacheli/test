# History of whirlybird

whirlybird first saw development in January of 2019. At that time, it was named
"Harmony" and was using the Node.js environment. Later, the project would rename
into "Space" and use the Deno environment. Today the project is now known as
"whirlybird."

I want to thank [@gspalato](https://github.com/gspalato) for starting this
journey with me.
