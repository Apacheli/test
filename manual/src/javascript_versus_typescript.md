# JavaScript Versus TypeScript

You can use whichever of the two languages that you prefer. You can also use
them both simultaneously. You can even use JavaScript even though whirlybird is
written in TypeScript.

For more information,
[see the Deno manual](https://deno.land/manual/typescript).

My take: TypeScript is not perfect, but it is one hell of a good bandage for
JavaScript.
